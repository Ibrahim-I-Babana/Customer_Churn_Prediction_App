# Customer_Churn_Prediction_App
This is data application that predicts customer churn at a telecommunications company
Losing customers is a major cost for any organization. Customer churn, also known as customer attrition or customer turnover, is the percentage of customers who stop using your companyâ€™s product or service within a certain period of time.
For example, if you started the year with 500 customers and ended with 480 customers, your customer churn rate would be 4%.
If we could understand the reasons and the timing of customer churn with reasonable accuracy, it would greatly help the organization to plan and implement effective retention strategies.

This is a Classification project aimed at assisting a telecommunications company understand their data and find the life time value of each customer and know what factors affect the rate at which customers stop using their network.



Elevate Your ML Models: From Development to Real-world Impact

You've successfully built robust machine learning models, but their true potential lies in deploying them for practical decision-making. Effective deployment is key to unlocking actionable insights and realizing the full impact of your models.

As an integral part of the CRISP-DM framework, model deployment seamlessly integrates your machine learning models into existing production environments, enabling informed business decisions based on data.


Project Focus: Embedding Machine Learning models into a user-friendly interface such as Streamlit for use by third party stakeholders who don't have the technical knowledge to read a Jupyter notebook.


Project Benefits:

Customizable GUI Components: Develop the skills to craft flexible and user-friendly Graphic User Interface (GUI) components with Streamlit.

Real-time Predictions: Deploy machine learning models using Streamlit, enabling real-time predictions for practical scenarios

CRISP-DM Final Step: Learn to embrace the industry-standard CRISP-DM framework to guide your data process from business understanding to model deployment. 


Skill Sets You'll Develop:

1. Understanding Deployment: Explore the significance of model deployment in real-world applications.

2. Saving Models for Deployment: Learn techniques for saving machine learning models optimized for deployment.

3. Project Requirements: Understand the importance of creating clear and concise project requirement files.

4. Streamlit Web App: Dive into creating a user-friendly web app using Streamlit.


In this project, we take a hands-on approach, embedding our pre-built models into a Graphic User Interface (GUI). For detailed information and code examples, explore this
